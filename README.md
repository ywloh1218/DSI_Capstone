# DSI_Capstone
This is my Capstone project that I produced during my time at the Data Science Immersive at General Assembly, Sydney

Using a dataset obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/apryor6/us-opiate-prescriptions) I used linear regression to predict opiate prescription, using non-opiate prescriptions as my predictor variables.

Using those predictions, it is theoretically possible to find prescribers engaging in fraudulent opiate prescriptions by identifying them through opiate prescriptions that do not fit the predictions made by the model.
